1. What is []?
R: A list

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable name spam? (Assume spam contains [2,4,6,8,10].)
R: spam[2] = 'hello'

For the following three questions, let's say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c' 'd'].

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluates to?
R: 'd' -> Operation int('3'*2) will return 33 (Type Integer) // (Divide with integral results) 11 will return 3. spam[3] will return 'd'.

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
R. 'd' -> -1 index will return the last position of the list

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
R. ['a', 'b'] -> The expression spam[:2] means an slice of the list starting at the beginning and ending at index 2 non inclusive. 

For the following three questions, let's say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
R. 1 -> It will return the index of the first coincidence in the list.

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
R. [3.14, 'cat', 11. 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
R. [3.14, 11, 'cat', True] -> The expression bacon.remove('cat') it will remove only the first coincidence.

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
R. Concatenation +, Replication *

10. What is the difference between the append() and the insert() list methods?
R. append() will always insert the new value at the end of the list, insert() method can insert the new value at any selected index.

11. What are two ways of remove values from a list?
R. list.remove('value'),  del list['index']

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values
R. An string could be represented as a non-mutable list of characters. Both lists and string can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
R. List are mutable; they can have values added, removed, or changed. Tuples are immutable; they can not be changed at all. Also tuples are writen using parentheses, ( and ), while list use the square brackets, [ and ]

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
R. (42,)

15. How can you get the tuple from a list value? How you can get the list from of a tuple value?
R. list(<tuple>), tuple(<list>)

16. Variables that 'contain' list values don't actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
R. They contain references to list values.

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
R. copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy of a list. That is ony copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any list inside the list.
